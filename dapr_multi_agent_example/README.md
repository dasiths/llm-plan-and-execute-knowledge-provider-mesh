# Multi-Agent Event-Driven Workflows
This quickstart demonstrates how to create and orchestrate event-driven workflows with multiple autonomous agents using Dapr Agents. You'll learn how to set up agents as services, implement workflow orchestration, and enable real-time agent collaboration through pub/sub messaging.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 (recommended)
- pip package manager
- OpenAI API key
- Dapr CLI and Docker installed

## Environment Setup

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3.10 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file for your API keys:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. Make sure Dapr is initialized on your system:

```bash
dapr init
```

3. The quickstart includes the necessary Dapr components in the `components` directory:

- `statestore.yaml`: Agent state configuration
- `pubsub.yaml`: Pub/Sub message bus configuration
- `workflowstate.yaml`: Workflow state configuration

## Examples

### Agent Service Implementation

Each agent is implemented as a separate service. Here's an example for the Hobbit agent:

```python
from dapr_agents import Agent, AgentActorService
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import asyncio
import logging

async def main():
    try:
        # Define Agent
        hobbit_agent = Agent(
            role="Hobbit",
            name="Frodo",
            goal="Take the ring to Mordor",
            instructions=["Speak like Frodo"]
        )
        
        # Expose Agent as a Service
        hobbit_service = AgentActorService(
            agent=hobbit_agent,
            message_bus_name="messagepubsub",
            agents_state_store_name="agentstatestore",
            port=8001,
        )

        await hobbit_service.start()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error starting service: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    load_dotenv()
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Similar implementations exist for the Wizard (Gandalf) and Elf (Legolas) agents.

### Workflow Orchestrator Implementations

The workflow orchestrators manage the interaction between agents. Currently, Dapr Agents support three workflow types: RoundRobin, Random, and LLM-based. Here's an example for the Random workflow orchestrator (you can find examples for RoundRobin and LLM-based orchestrators in the project):

```python
from dapr_agents import RandomOrchestrator
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import asyncio
import logging

async def main():
    try:
        random_workflow_service = RandomOrchestrator(
            name="RandomOrchestrator",
            message_bus_name="messagepubsub",
            state_store_name="agenticworkflowstate",
            state_key="workflow_state",
            agents_registry_store_name="agentstatestore",
            agents_registry_key="agents_registry",
            service_port=8009,
            max_iterations=3
        )
        await random_workflow_service.start()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error starting service: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    load_dotenv()
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Running the Multi-Agent System

The project includes three dapr multi-app run configuration files (`dapr-random.yaml`, `dapr-roundrobin.yaml` and `dapr-llm.yaml` ) for running all services and an additional Client application for interacting with the agents:

Example: `dapr-random.yaml`
```yaml
version: 1
common:
  resourcesPath: ./components
  logLevel: info
  appLogDestination: console
  daprdLogDestination: console

apps:
- appID: HobbitApp
  appDirPath: ./services/hobbit/
  appPort: 8001
  command: ["python3", "app.py"]

- appID: WizardApp
  appDirPath: ./services/wizard/
  appPort: 8002
  command: ["python3", "app.py"]

- appID: ElfApp
  appDirPath: ./services/elf/
  appPort: 8003
  command: ["python3", "app.py"]

- appID: WorkflowApp
  appDirPath: ./services/workflow-random/
  appPort: 8004
  command: ["python3", "app.py"]

- appID: ClientApp
  appDirPath: ./services/client/
  command: ["python3", "client.py"]
```

Start all services using the Dapr CLI:

<!-- STEP
name: Run text completion example
match_order: none
expected_stdout_lines:
  - "Workflow started successfully!"
  - "user:"
  - "How to get to Mordor? We all need to help!"
  - "assistant:"
  - "user:"
  - "assistant:"
  - "workflow completed with status 'ORCHESTRATION_STATUS_COMPLETED' workflowName 'RandomWorkflow'"
timeout_seconds: 120
output_match_mode: substring
background: false
sleep: 5
-->
```bash
dapr run -f dapr-random.yaml 
```
<!-- END_STEP -->

You will see the agents engaging in a conversation about getting to Mordor, with different agents contributing based on their character.

You can also run the RoundRobin and LLM-based orchestrators using `dapr-roundrobin.yaml` and `dapr-llm.yaml` respectively:

<!-- STEP
name: Run text completion example
match_order: none
expected_stdout_lines:
  - "Workflow started successfully!"
  - "user:"
  - "How to get to Mordor? We all need to help!"
  - "assistant:"
  - "user:"
  - "assistant:"
  - "workflow completed with status 'ORCHESTRATION_STATUS_COMPLETED' workflowName 'RoundRobinWorkflow'"
timeout_seconds: 120
output_match_mode: substring
background: false
sleep: 5
-->
```bash
dapr run -f dapr-roundrobin.yaml 
```
<!-- END_STEP -->

<!-- STEP
name: Run text completion example
match_order: none
expected_stdout_lines:
  - "Workflow started successfully!"
  - "user:"
  - "How to get to Mordor? We all need to help!"
  - "assistant:"
  - "user:"
  - "assistant:"
  - "workflow completed with status 'ORCHESTRATION_STATUS_COMPLETED' workflowName 'LLMWorkflow'"
timeout_seconds: 200
output_match_mode: substring
background: false
sleep: 5
-->
```bash
dapr run -f dapr-llm.yaml 
```
<!-- END_STEP -->
**Expected output:** The agents will engage in a conversation about getting to Mordor, with different agents contributing based on their character. Observe that in the logs, or checking the workflow state in [Redis Insights](https://dapr.github.io/dapr-agents/home/installation/#enable-redis-insights).

## Key Concepts
- **Agent Service**: Stateful service exposing an agent via API endpoints with independent lifecycle management
- **Pub/Sub Messaging**: Event-driven communication between agents for real-time collaboration
- **State Store**: Persistent storage for both agent registration and conversational memory
- **Actor Model**: Self-contained, sequential message processing via Dapr's Virtual Actor pattern
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Coordinating agent interactions in a durable and resilient manner

## Workflow Types
Dapr Agents supports multiple workflow orchestration patterns:

1. **RoundRobin**: Cycles through agents sequentially, ensuring equal task distribution
2. **Random**: Selects agents randomly for tasks, useful for load balancing and testing
3. **LLM-based**: Uses an LLM (default: OpenAI's models like gpt-4o) to intelligently select agents based on context and task requirements

## Monitoring and Observability
1. **Console Logs**: Monitor real-time workflow execution and agent interactions
2. **Dapr Dashboard**: View components, configurations and service details at http://localhost:8080/
3. **Zipkin Tracing**: Access distributed tracing at http://localhost:9411/zipkin/
4. **Dapr Metrics**: Access agent performance metrics via (ex: HobbitApp) http://localhost:6001/metrics when configured

## Troubleshooting

1. **Service Startup**: If services fail to start, verify Dapr components configuration
2. **Communication Issues**: Check Redis connection and pub/sub setup
3. **Workflow Errors**: Check Zipkin traces for detailed request flows
4. **Port Conflicts**: If ports are already in use, check which port is already in use
5. **System Reset**: Clear Redis data through Redis Insights if needed

## Next Steps

After completing this quickstart, you can:

- Add more agents to the workflow
- Switch to another workflow orchestration pattern (RoundRobin, LLM-based)
- Extend agents with custom tools
- Deploy agents and Dapr to a Kubernetes cluster. For more information on read [Deploy Dapr on a Kubernetes cluster](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-deploy)
