LangChain PlanAndExecute: https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/plan_and_execute

This file uses streamlit, so `streamlit run agents_example.py` to run it.

Run `python3 weather_app.py` to start the required weather service.
Run `python3 ./store_and_stock_app.py` to start the required store and stock services.
