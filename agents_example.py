LangChain PlanAndExecute: https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/langchain-implementation-of-plan-and-solve-prompting-6fd2270c68f5

This file uses streamlit, so `streamlit run agents_example.py` to run it.

Run `python3 weather_app.py` to start the required weather service.
Run `python3 ./store_and_stock_app.py` to start the required store and stock services.
